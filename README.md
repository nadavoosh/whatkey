Answers "what key am I pressing?" as simply as possible.

I went looking for this when I was putting my keyboard back together after cleaning, and most of what I could find was [full featured](http://keyboardchecker.com/) when I wanted simple. 

I also found some [absolutley delightful](http://www.keyboardtester.com/) approaches.
