# whatkey
Answers "what key am I pressing?" as simply as possible. Deployed at [WhatKeyAmIPressing.com](http://whatkeyamipressing.com).

I went looking for this when I was putting my keyboard back together after cleaning, and most of what I could find was [full featured](http://keyboardchecker.com/) when I wanted simple. 

I also found some [absolutley delightful](http://www.keyboardtester.com/) approaches.

this version of whatkey shows multiple keys if they are all being pressed at once. For example, Control + Shift + B. Added by [marvil :D](https://github.com/marvil6)
